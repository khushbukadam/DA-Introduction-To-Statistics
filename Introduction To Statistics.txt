ANS:-

Key Properties of a Normal Distribution
1.Shape
    ->Symmetrical, bell-shaped curve.
    ->Mean (μ), Median, and Mode are all equal and located at the center.

2.Probability Density Function (PDF)
 For a function \(f(x)\) to be a valid PDF, it must satisfy two main properties: 
  Non-negativity: The function's value can never be negative.
   \(f(x)\ge 0\) for all \(x\)

->Total area equals one: The total area under the entire curve of the PDF must be equal to 1, as the sum of all possible probabilities is 100%.\(\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }f(x)\,dx=1\) 


3.Spread (Standard Deviation, σ)
Controls how "wide" or "narrow" the curve is.
Larger σ → wider curve; Smaller σ → narrower curve.

4.Empirical Rule (68–95–99.7 Rule)

About 68% of values fall within 1σ of the mean.
About 95% fall within 2σ.
About 99.7% fall within 3σ.

5.Asymptotic
The curve approaches, but never touches, the x-axis.

6.Total Area = 1
The area under the curve (probability space) equals 1.

7.Standard Normal Distribution

A special case with mean μ = 0 and standard deviation σ = 1.
Values can be converted to this form using z-scores:


2). Define:
ans:-
o Probability Density Function (PDF):-
A probability density function (PDF) is a function that describes the relative likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a given value. It is defined for continuous random variables, which can take on any value within a specified range (e.g., the height of a person or the time it takes to travel to work).

The PDF itself doesn't give the probability of a specific value because for a continuous variable, the probability of it being exactly one single value is zero. Instead, the probability is found by calculating the area under the curve of the PDF over a specific range or interval. This is done using integral calculus.

o Z-Score:-
A Z-score (also known as a standard score) is a measurement that describes a data point's relationship to the mean of a group of values. It's measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean.

o Standard Normal Distribution
The standard normal distribution, also known as the z-distribution, is a specific type of normal distribution. It's a fundamental concept in statistics because it provides a common framework for analyzing and comparing different datasets.

3. Differentiate between:
o Discrete vs. Continuous Distributions

| **Examples**               | Dice, coins, number of calls    | Height, weight, time, temperature                    |


o Binomial vs. Normal Distribution

| Feature        | Binomial Distribution          | Normal Distribution           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |

• Practical Section
4. In a standardized test, scores follow a normal distribution with mean = 100, std.
dev = 15:
• What is the probability that a student scores above 115?
ans:-The probability that a student scores above 115 on the standardized test is approximately **0.1587**, or **15.87%**.

Here's how the calculation is performed:

### 1. Calculate the Z-score

First, we calculate the Z-score for a score of 115 using the formula:
$$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$
Given:
* Score ($x$) = 115
* Mean ($\mu$) = 100
* Standard Deviation ($\sigma$) = 15

$$z = \frac{115 - 100}{15} = \frac{15}{15} = 1$$

A Z-score of 1 means that a score of 115 is exactly **one standard deviation above the mean**.

---
 2. Find the Probability

Next, we use a Z-table or statistical software to find the cumulative probability associated with a Z-score of 1. This tells us the probability of a student scoring **at or below** 115. This value is approximately **0.8413**.

Since we want to find the probability of a score being **above** 115, we subtract the cumulative probability from 1:

$$P(X > 115) = 1 - P(X \le 115)$$
$$P(X > 115) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587$$

This result means that roughly 15.87% of students are expected to score above 115 on the test.

• What percentage of students scored between 85 and 115?
Approximately **68.27%** of students scored between 85 and 115 on the standardized test.

---

### 1. Calculate the Z-Scores

First, we find the Z-scores for both the lower and upper scores:

* **For a score of 85:**
    $$z = \frac{85 - 100}{15} = \frac{-15}{15} = -1$$
    This means a score of 85 is **one standard deviation below the mean**.

* **For a score of 115:**
    $$z = \frac{115 - 100}{15} = \frac{15}{15} = 1$$
    This means a score of 115 is **one standard deviation above the mean**.

---

### 2. Find the Probability

The probability of a score falling between 85 and 115 is the area under the normal distribution curve between the Z-scores of -1 and +1. We calculate this by finding the cumulative probability up to 115 and subtracting the cumulative probability up to 85.

* Cumulative probability for a score of 115 ($P(X \le 115)$) is approximately **0.8413**.
* Cumulative probability for a score of 85 ($P(X \le 85)$) is approximately **0.1587**.

The probability between the two scores is:
$$P(85 \le X \le 115) = P(X \le 115) - P(X \le 85)$$
$$P(85 \le X \le 115) = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826$$

Converting this to a percentage gives us 68.26%, which is often rounded to 68.27% due to the Z-table values and statistical approximations.

This result aligns with the **Empirical Rule** (or 68-95-99.7 rule), which states that for a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.

5. A dataset contains test scores of 100 students:
dataset:-
37,23,59,54,44,27,24,55,56,25,36,53,24,37,25,34,12,20,14,27,37,31,14,49,22,
31,35,29,17,19,54,44,47,36,22,50,12,59,22,48,52,19,29,42,36,13,27,19,15,42,
24,45,17,33,12,20,50,51,37,46,42,41,57,49,17,30,47,33,40,18,14,55,33,31,17,
32,57,47,48,58,42,48,35,54,53,17,39,58,27,21,57,38,57,58,49,39,49,20,41,20

• Create a histogram and verify the data follows a normal distribution.
ANS:-I have created a histogram of the test scores and performed a statistical test to verify if the data follows a normal distribution.

Based on the histogram and the statistical test, the dataset of student test scores does not appear to follow a normal distribution.

Statistical Analysis
Mean Score: 35.81

Standard Deviation: 14.30

To statistically verify the distribution, I used the Shapiro-Wilk test. This test calculates a p-value to determine if the sample data is significantly different from a normal distribution.

Shapiro-Wilk Test Statistic: 0.9457

P-value: 0.0004

Since the p-value (0.0004) is very low (less than the common significance level of 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis that the data comes from a normal distribution.

Visual Analysis
The histogram also supports this conclusion. A normal distribution would typically show a symmetrical, bell-shaped curve with the majority of the data clustered around the mean. Instead, the histogram shows a bimodal distribution with two distinct peaks, one around the scores of 20 and another around the scores of 50. This shape is characteristic of a non-normal distribution and suggests that the dataset may contain two or more subgroups of students with different score patterns.

• Calculate Z-score for a student who scored 130.

ANS:-Z-Score Calculation
A Z-score is calculated using the formula: \(z=\frac{x-\mu }{\sigma }\), where \(x\) is the raw score, \(\mu \) is the population mean, and \(\sigma \) is the population standard deviation. 

Step-by-step solution     
 The given raw score is \(x=130\).
 The population mean is assumed to be \(\mu =100\). 
The population standard deviation is assumed to be \(\sigma =15\). 
The values are substituted into the Z-score formula: \(z=\frac{130-100}{15}\). 
The numerator is calculated: \(130-100=30\). 
The Z-score is then calculated by dividing the result by the standard deviation: \(z=\frac{30}{15}=2\).

• Interpret the Z-score meaning in this context

A Z-score indicates how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of a dataset. A positive Z-score means the value is above average, a negative Z-score indicates it's below average, and a Z-score of zero signifies the value is exactly at the mean. For example, a Z-score of +2 means the data point is two standard deviations above the mean, while a Z-score of -1 means it is one standard deviation below the mean. 

To interpret a Z-score, consider:
The sign: A positive sign (+ ) indicates the value is above the average (mean), while a negative sign (-) means it is below the average. 
The magnitude: The absolute value of the Z-score tells you how many standard deviations the data point is from the mean. 
The context of the data: The "unusualness" of a data point depends on the distribution of all data points. A value that is 3 standard deviations from the mean might be considered rare in a typical dataset. 

Here are some general interpretations of Z-scores: 
Z = 0: The data point's value is exactly the same as the mean.
Z = +1: The value is one standard deviation above the mean.
Z = -1: The value is one standard deviation below the mean.
Z = +2: The value is two standard deviations above the mean.
Z = -3: The value is three standard deviations below the mean.

Example of Interpretation:
Imagine a Z-score of 1.75 for an exam score. 
The sign is positive (+): This means the score is above the class average.
The magnitude is 1.75: This means the score is 1.75 standard deviations above the average score. This is a relatively strong performance compared to the rest of the class.
